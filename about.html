                <p>
                    I'm Isaac, and I'm from Hong Kong. Currently, I am studying abroad at LSE, which is approximately 9616.28 
                    kilometers away from my home.
                </p>

                <p>
                    As you can already tell, I like analysing numbers - that's probably the reason why I chose to study finance 
                    in the first place. I like looking at macroeconomic data, such as consumer and producer price indicies, 
                    non-farm payrolls, and even implicit statistics such as Fed Fund Futures, to understand our economy and 
                    predict what may happen in markets. I'm also curious as to what drives the growth of a company, and its 
                    share price, prompting me to read their annual reports and investigate their competitive advantages. 
                    Ultimately, these factors would help me develop a prediction of what would happen a stock, and it brings me 
                    great satisfaction to see my trade ideas be executed in real life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But what is finance without coding? I like problem solving, applying algorithms to real data, and analysing 
                    them with graphs. Even if that means pulling my hair out when I'm debugging code. Being proficient in Python 
                    with 4 years of experience, I've been experimenting and using it for data analysis. I've also been applying 
                    more complex mathematical models into my code, and although it takes a <i>long</i> and <i>painful</i> time 
                    to understand, it brings me great joy when I finally get it.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I also like learning new things: practicing for the CFA, taking German classes at university, cooking 
                    meals, and exploring different societies. Beyond academics, I write frequently, whether that is 
                    self-publishing my book on Amazon, or contributing to my school's blogs / magazines. I think writing 
                    (literature) is the best way to express oneself, in the sense that complex ideas and emotions can be 
                    conveyed eloquently and simplistically. Music too - I really love classical music. Rachmaninoff's Piano 
                    Concerto No. 2 and Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto No. 1 are two of my favourites.
                </p>

                <p>
                    That's basically me summarised in a few paragraphs.
