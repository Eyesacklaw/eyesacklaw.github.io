          <h2>Forecasting Volatility</h2>
          <p>Forecasting the volatility of a stock is crucial in portfolio optimisation, risk management, and 
            pricing options. Our team evaluated the effectiveness of machine learning models (LSTM) compared to 
            traditional stochastic methods (EWMA, GARCH) in forecasting volatility. Using TensorFlow's LSTM 
            library, we created features for the models, trained the models against in-sample and validation data, 
            and calculated the QLIKE (Quasi-Likelihood Loss Function) of the model to determine its effectiveness.
            </p>
          <p>
            We implemented 2 LSTM models. The first one directly predicted volatility, whereas the second one 
            followed a "hybrid" approach, where they would predict the residuals from our GARCH model, and 
            both models would be combined to form a prediction. We thought that it would be easier for the model 
            to predict residuals as they aren't forecasting volatility directly.
          </p>
          <p>
            In terms of our results, we found that pure and hybrid LSTM models underperform stochastic models such 
            as GJR-GARCH/GARCH, if the inputs only consisted of price derived features (e.g. returns). However, 
            observing the forecasted volatility of LSTM models, we can see that it does adjust to external shocks, 
            and it follows the realised volatility trend pretty well. We also noticed that if more features are 
            fed into our model (such as VIX, volume, and other factors influencing volatility), the LSTM model 
            <b>outperformed</b> stochastic models by approximately 20%.

          <h2>Monte Carlo Simulations for Portfolio Optimisation</h2>
          <p>Through Monte Carlo Simulations, this project aims to investigate the optimal weights for each stock 
            in a portfolio. By generating random weights for a portfolio and plotting their returns and volatility, 
            we derive the mean-variance efficient frontier. The Sharpe ratio is calculated for each point using the 
            slope of the line passing through the point and the risk free rate. The tangency portfolio, or the 
            portfolio with the highest Sharpe Ratio is subsequently determined.
          </p>
          <p>
            [Sharpe Ratio determines the investment's return relative to its risk.]
